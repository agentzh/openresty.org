# Acknowledgment

Special thanks go to all our developers and contributors! Also thanks Thibault Charbonnier
for his great help in preparing this release.

# Version highlights

The highlights of this release candidate are:

* Based on the very recent mainline [nginx](nginx.html) core 1.15.8.
* Support for ARM64 architectures. The underlying work for this feature
allowed to speed up other architectures by up to ~10%.
* New [lua-resty-shell](https://github.com/openresty/lua-resty-shell#readme) library for efficiently spawning sub-processes via the
new [ngx.pipe](https://github.com/openresty/lua-resty-core/blob/master/lib/ngx/pipe.md#readme) API.
* New [lua-resty-signal](https://github.com/openresty/lua-resty-signal#readme) library for killing and sending signals to UNIX
processes.
* New [lua-tablepool](https://github.com/openresty/lua-tablepool#readme) library for efficiently recycling Lua tables.
* We dropped support for the standard Lua 5.1 interpreter, and vividly
recommend the use of OpenResty's fork of LuaJIT.
* [ngx_lua](https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#readme)
    * New [ngx.pipe](https://github.com/openresty/lua-resty-core/blob/master/lib/ngx/pipe.md#readme) API which allows spawning sub-processes and communicating
    with them in a non-blocking way.
    * Support for connections backlog queuing in cosockets via the new pool_size
    and backlog options of the [tcpsock:connect()](https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#tcpsockconnect) method.
    * New [tcpsock:receiveany()](https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#tcpsockreceiveany) API for BSD-style receive.
* [ngx_stream_lua](https://github.com/openresty/stream-lua-nginx-module#readme) module
    * New [reqsock:peek()](https://github.com/openresty/stream-lua-nginx-module#reqsockpeek) API for the [ngx_stream_lua](https://github.com/openresty/stream-lua-nginx-module#readme) module, to peek into the
    preread buffer without consuming the data.
    * We enabled support for [ssl_certificate_by_lua*](https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#ssl_certificate_by_lua_block) in the [ngx_stream_lua](https://github.com/openresty/stream-lua-nginx-module#readme)
    module.
    * We enabled support for the FFI-based shdict API, [ngx.semaphore](https://github.com/openresty/lua-resty-core/blob/master/lib/ngx/semaphore.md#readme), and
    [ngx.errlog](https://github.com/openresty/lua-resty-core/blob/master/lib/ngx/errlog.md#readme).
* LuaJIT
    * We now enable the GC64 mode of LuaJIT by default on x86_64
    platforms.
    * Implemented a new [table.isempty()](https://github.com/openresty/luajit2#tableisempty) API.
    * Implemented a new [table.isarray()](https://github.com/openresty/luajit2#tableisarray) API.
    * Implemented a new [table.nkeys()](https://github.com/openresty/luajit2#tablenkeys) API.

    All our new Lua API functions documentation can be found here: https://github.com/openresty/luajit2#new-api

    * bugfix: [tcpsock:setkeepalive()](https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#tcpsocksetkeepalive): worker processes might take too long to gracefully shutdown when the keep alive connections take a long max idle time. _Thanks Dejiang Zhu for the patch._
    * bugfix: setting the request "Host" header should clear any existing cached `$host` variable so that subsequent reads return the expected result.
    * bugfix: inlined Lua code snippets in `nginx.conf` failed to use the Lua source checksum as part of the Lua code cache key.
    * bugfix: silenced `-Wcast-function-type` warnings, allowing for compilation with gcc8. _Thanks Alessandro Ghedini for the patch._

    * doc: made it clearer that we depend on [lua-resty-core](https://github.com/openresty/lua-resty-core#readme).
    * doc: documented the limitations of certain [ngx_lua](https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#readme) execution contexts which prohibit yielding.
