# Acknowledgments

Special thanks go to all our developers and contributors! Also thanks Junlong Li,

# Version highlights

The highlights of this release candidate are:

* Based on the very recent mainline [NGINX](nginx.html) core [% major_ver %].
* Many fixes imported from Mike Pall's upstream [LuaJIT](https://github.com/openresty/luajit2#readme) repository...
* When lua failed in requesting memory, instead of graceful shutdown, `abort()` is called.
* Now the `get_ctx_table` supports using the ctx table from caller, and that will reduce the cost of creating a new ctx table.
* For a better performance when using [lua-tablepool](https://github.com/openresty/lua-tablepool), discard the objects when the pool size is larger than the max_pool_size.
* Implemented process API for stream subsystem.
