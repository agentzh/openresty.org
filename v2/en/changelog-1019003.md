# Version 1.19.3.2 - 4 June 2021

* build-win32.sh: upgraded openssl to 1.1.1k.
* bugfix: applied the patch for security advisory to NGINX cores >= 0.6.18 and <= 1.20.0 (CVE-2021-23017).

# Version 1.19.3.1 - 6 Nov 2020

* upgraded the nginx core to 1.19.3.
    * see the changes here: https://nginx.org/en/CHANGES

* upgraded [ngx_lua](https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#readme) to 0.10.19.
    * optimize: post zombie thread: avoided the linear search.
    * bugfix: `ngx.resp.set_headers()`: may cause an error when Content-Length field is larger than 2^32. _Thanks Johnny Wang for the patch._
    * bugfix: process may crash when a timer run failed and a function with arguments run inside this timer. _Thanks lijunlong for the patch._
    * bugfix: wrong pipelined request body length when request body is parent's request body. _Thanks lijunlong for the patch._
    * bugfix: ngx.flush never blocks on http v2. _Thanks lijunlong for the patch._
    * feature: implemented the new `tcpsock:setoption()` function for setting options for the TCP socket. _Thanks poorsea for the patch._
    * bugfix: `ngx.resp.get_headers()`: may return a wrong (like: negative) value of the Content-Length field when it is larger than 2^32. _Thanks LubinLew for the patch._
    * optimize: added the "ev" to `ngx_posted_delayed_events` instead of the rbtree for 0 delay timer, so that we can save an epoll wait in such case. _Thanks syz for the patch._
    * feature: implemented the new `ngx.ssl.server_port()` API to get server port. _Thanks Yan Zhu for the patch._
    * bugfix: build error with nginx 1.7.4 or older version. _Thanks timebug for the patch._
    * optimize: now we make use of the new `lua_getexdata2` and `lua_setexdata2` to attach coctx to the Lua thread objects directly which save the lookup overhead which can become the bottleneck when there are many Lua light threads around in a single request handler.
    * feature: now we recycle lua thread GC objects for our "light threads" and added `lua_thread_cache_max_entries` directive to configure the cache size.
    * feature: added new C API `ngx_http_lua_pcre_version` to wrap the `pcre_version()` C API in libpcre.
    * bugfix: double values larger than `int32_t` were incorrectly printed out as 64-bit integers. _Thanks lijunlong for the patch._
    * bugfix: the format in argerror messages are incorrect. _Thanks Alexander Drozdov for the patch._
    * feature: shared `ngx.ctx` among SSL_* phases and the following phases. _Thanks spacewander for the patch._
    * feature(socket.tcp): enhance the logic of parameter verification in connect. _Thanks Jinhua Tan for the patch._
    * bugfix: the body size may overflow since the size_t is only int32 in 32-bit system. _Thanks syz for the patch._
    * feature: added the `ngx_http_lua_ffi_balancer_recreate_request` FFI function to allow recreation of request buffer in balancer phase. _Thanks Datong Sun for the patch._
    * feature: add FFI interface to verify SSL client certificate. _Thanks ArchangelSDY for the patch._
    * feature: added `exit_worker_by*` to run Lua code upon nginx worker process exit. _Thanks letian & Jinhua Tan for the patch._
    * optimize: avoided use of `lua_tolstring` in `ngx_http_lua_calc_strlen_in_table`, `ngx_http_lua_copy_str_in_table`, `ngx_http_lua_socket_udp_send`, `log_wrapper` and `ngx_http_lua_ngx_echo`. _Thanks lijunlong for the patch._
    * feature: supported receiveany on `ngx.req.socket(true?)` socks. _Thanks Guy Lewin for the patch._

* upgraded [ngx_stream_lua](https://github.com/openresty/stream-lua-nginx-module#readme) to 0.0.9.
    * bugfix: process may crash when a timer run failed and a function with arguments run inside this timer. _Thanks lijunlong for the patch._
    * feature: added the receiveany function for raw req socket. _Thanks tangsty for the patch._
    * feature: implemented the new `ngx.ssl.server_port()` API to get server port. _Thanks Yan Zhu for the patch._
    * feature: added new C API `ngx_stream_lua_pcre_version` to wrap the `pcre_version()` C API in libpcre.
    * feature: shared `ngx.ctx` among SSL_* phases and the following phases. _Thanks spacewander for the patch._
    * bugfix: the stream subsystem was built incorrectly in debug mode. _Thanks spacewander for the patch._
    * bugfix: hide get_request API in stream subsystem. _Thanks spacewander for the patch._
    * feature: add FFI interface to verify SSL client certificate. _Thanks ArchangelSDY for the patch._

* upgraded [lua-resty-core](https://github.com/openresty/lua-resty-core#readme) to v0.1.21.
    * bugfix: invalid write in `ffi.copy` since we missed the len argument, it is caught by the valgrind mode in ec2 testing. _Thanks lijunlong for the patch._
    * feature: implemented the new `tcpsock:setoption()` function for setting options for the TCP socket. _Thanks poorsea for the patch._
    * feature: implemented the new `ngx.ssl.server_port()` API to get server port. _Thanks Yan Zhu for the patch._
    * change: now we require `ngx_http_lua` 0.10.18 and `ngx_stream_lua` 0.0.9.
    * bugfix: `resty.core.regex` would fail to load silently on Windows. now we use `ngx_http_lua` or `ngx_stream_lua` modules' pcre version API wrapper to avoid such symbol exporting pains.
    * feature: shared `ngx.ctx` among SSL_* phases and the following phases. _Thanks spacewander for the patch._
    * bugfix: added the missing 'ngx.req.start_time' to the stream subsystem. _Thanks Thibault Charbonnier for the patch._
    * feature: add the `balancer.recreate_request` function, which allows user to recreate request buffer in balancer phase. _Thanks Datong Sun for the patch._
    * feature: implemented the new `ssl.verify_client()` API to require a client certificate during TLS handshake. _Thanks ArchangelSDY for the patch._
    * feature: add `exit_worker` as new phase. _Thanks letian & Jinhua Tan for the patch._

    * feature: resty: now we cache the original `ngx.say`/`ngx.print` functions into `ngx.orig_say` and `ngx.orig_print` since some times the user would need them.
