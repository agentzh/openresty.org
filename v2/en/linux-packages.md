All our repositories' metadata (and rpm binary packages) are signed by the following GPG key, `0xD5EDEB74`:

https://openresty.org/package/pubkey.gpg

**IMPORTANT!** All the official binary packages for Intel `x86_64` CPUs require SSE 4.2 instruction support in the CPU.
If you use an old CPU that does not support SSE 4.2, then you need to build OpenResty from its source tarball on *that*
CPU yourself. See the [Download](download.html) and [Installation](installation.html) page for details. Otherwise you
will see the `Illegal instruction` error when using the binary packages on your CPUs lacking SSE 4.2 support.

# Ubuntu

Note: if nginx is already installed and running, try disabling and stopping it before installing openresty like below:

```bash
sudo systemctl disable nginx
sudo systemctl stop nginx
```

Otherwise the installation might fail.

You can add our APT repository to your Ubuntu system so as to easily install
our packages and receive updates in the future (via the `apt-get update` command). To add the repository, just
run the following commands (only need to run once for each system):

```bash
# import our GPG key:
wget -qO - https://openresty.org/package/pubkey.gpg | sudo apt-key add -

# for installing the add-apt-repository command
# (you can remove this package and its dependencies later):
sudo apt-get -y install software-properties-common

# add the our official APT repository:
sudo add-apt-repository -y "deb http://openresty.org/package/ubuntu $(lsb_release -sc) main"

# to update the APT index:
sudo apt-get update
```

Then you can install a package, say, `openresty`, like this:

```bash
sudo apt-get install openresty
```

This package also recommends the `openresty-opm` and `openresty-restydoc` packages so the latter two will
also automatically get installed by default. If that is not what you want, you can disable the automatic
installation of recommended packages like this:

```bash
sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends openresty
```

See the [OpenResty Deb Packages](deb-packages.html) page for more details on all available packages in this
repository.

# Debian

Note: if nginx is already installed and running, try disabling and stopping it before installing openresty like below:

```bash
sudo systemctl disable nginx
sudo systemctl stop nginx
```

Otherwise the installation might fail.

## Debian Jessie or Later

You can add the `openresty` repository to your Debian system so as to easily install
our packages and receive updates in the future (via the `apt-get update` command). To add the repository, just
run the following commands (only need to run once for each system):

```bash
# import our GPG key:
wget -qO - https://openresty.org/package/pubkey.gpg | sudo apt-key add -

# for installing the add-apt-repository command
# (you can remove this package and its dependencies later):
sudo apt-get -y install software-properties-common

# add the our official APT repository:
sudo add-apt-repository -y "deb http://openresty.org/package/debian $(lsb_release -sc) openresty"

# to update the APT index:
sudo apt-get update
```

Then you can install a package, say, `openresty`, like this:

```bash
sudo apt-get install openresty
```

This package also recommends the `openresty-opm` and `openresty-restydoc` packages so the latter two will
also automatically get installed by default. If that is not what you want, you can disable the automatic
installation of recommended packages like this:

```bash
sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends openresty
```

See the [OpenResty Deb Packages](deb-packages.html) page for more details on all available packages in this
repository.

## Debian Wheezy

You can add the `openresty` repository to your Deian Wheezy system so as to easily install
our packages and receive updates in the future (via the `apt-get update` command). To add the repository, just
run the following commands (only need to run once for each system):

```bash
# import our GPG key:
wget -qO - https://openresty.org/package/pubkey.gpg | sudo apt-key add -

# for installing the add-apt-repository command
# (you can remove this package and its dependencies later):
sudo apt-get -y install python-software-properties

# enable the wheezy-backports repository:
sudo add-apt-repository -y "deb http://ftp.debian.org/debian wheezy-backports main"

# add the our official APT repository:
sudo add-apt-repository -y "deb http://openresty.org/package/debian $(lsb_release -sc) openresty"

# to update the APT index:
sudo apt-get update
```

Then you can install a package, say, `openresty`, like this:

```bash
sudo apt-get install openresty
```

This package also recommends the `openresty-opm` and `openresty-restydoc` packages so the latter two will
also automatically get installed by default. If that is not what you want, you can disable the automatic
installation of recommended packages like this:

```bash
sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends openresty
```

See the [OpenResty Deb Packages](deb-packages.html) page for more details on all available packages in this
repository.

# CentOS

You can add the `openresty` repository to your CentOS system so as to easily install
our packages and receive updates in the future (via the `yum update` command). To add the repository, just
run the following commands:

```bash
sudo yum install yum-utils
sudo yum-config-manager --add-repo https://openresty.org/package/centos/openresty.repo
```

Then you can install a package, say, `openresty`, like this:

```bash
sudo yum install openresty
```

If you want to install the `resty` command-line utility, then install the `openresty-resty` package like below:

```bash
sudo yum install openresty-resty
```

The `opm` command-line utility is in the `openresty-opm` package while the `restydoc` utility is in the
`openresty-doc` package.

To list all the packages in the `openresty` repository:

```bash
sudo yum --disablerepo="*" --enablerepo="openresty" list available
```

See the [OpenResty RPM Packages](rpm-packages.html) page for more details on all these packages.

# RHEL

You can add the `openresty` repository to your Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) system so as to easily install
our packages and receive updates in the future (via the `yum update` command). To add the repository, just
run the following commands:

```bash
sudo yum install yum-utils
sudo yum-config-manager --add-repo https://openresty.org/package/rhel/openresty.repo
```

On older systems like RHEL 6.x, the last command may yield the following error due to a problem in its
`yum-config-manager` command:

```
[Errno 14] Peer cert cannot be verified or peer cert invalid
```

If this error happens, then you can just use the following command instead to enable the repository:


```bash
sudo yum-config-manager --add-repo http://openresty.org/package/rhel/openresty.repo
```

After adding the package repository, you can now install a package, say, `openresty`, like this:

```bash
sudo yum install openresty
```

If you want to install the `resty` command-line utility, then install the `openresty-resty` package like below:

```bash
sudo yum install openresty-resty
```

The `opm` command-line utility is in the `openresty-opm` package while the `restydoc` utility is in the
`openresty-doc` package.

To list all the packages in the `openresty` repository:

```bash
sudo yum --disablerepo="*" --enablerepo="openresty" list available
```

See the [OpenResty RPM Packages](rpm-packages.html) page for more details on all these packages.

# Fedora

You can enable the `openresty` repository on your Fedora system like this:

```bash
sudo dnf install dnf-plugins-core
sudo dnf config-manager --add-repo https://openresty.org/package/fedora/openresty.repo
```

Then you can easily install packages from the `openresty-openresty` repository and receive updates
in the future (through the `dnf update` command). For example, to install the `openresty` package, we can just run the
following command:

```bash
sudo dnf install openresty
```

If you want to install the `resty` command-line utility, then install the `openresty-resty` package like below:

```bash
sudo dnf install openresty-resty
```

The `opm` command-line utility is in the `openresty-opm` package while the `restydoc` utility is in the
`openresty-doc` package.

To list all the available packages in the `openresty-openresty` repository, just type

```bash
sudo dnf repo-pkgs openresty list available
```

See the [OpenResty RPM Packages](rpm-packages.html) page for more details on these packages.

# Amazon Linux

```

See the [OpenResty RPM Packages](rpm-packages.html) page for more details on all these packages.

# Support for More Linux Distributions
